However, you can also use any model you want. Mistral was used before as well. To
pull models, you use the command ollama pull then the name of the model you want. To see the models that have been pulled use the command ollama list. 

Make sure to update the configuration.env with any path changes and model changes.
Items in the configuration.env are:
    -   COLLECTION_PATH - Path to place the chromadb when it is created
    -   COLLECTION_NAME - Name of the chromadb 
    -   PDF_PATH - Path that the PDFs are located to be loaded
    -   LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL - Name of the model to use for embedding
    -   LLM_QUERY_MODEL - Name of the model to use for the querys of data in loaded PDFs

To reset the chromadb call the python script using the command python .\populate_db.py --reset. To run without clearing the chromadb, remove the --reset from the command.

To execute a query on the loaded PDFs use the command python .\query_db.py "Enter question in quotes".
